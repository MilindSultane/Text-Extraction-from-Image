# Text-Extraction-from-Image
Text detection and recognition from images could have numerous functional  applications for document analysis, such as assistance for visually impaired people;  recognition of vehicle license plates; evaluation of articles containing tables, street  signs, maps, and diagrams; keyword-based image exploration; document retrieval;  recognition of parts within industrial automation; content-based extraction; object  recognition; address block location; and text-based video indexing. This research  exploited the advantages of artificial intelligence (AI) to detect and recognize text from  natural images. Machine learning and deep learning were used to accomplish this task.
